# Pedro Tae Young Chang

DevOps Engineer who loves working in the commandline. If I can find a way to use the commandline, I will.

I love Linux, Kubernetes, Cloud, Postgres, and Python.

I am currently learning [Go](https://go.dev), and am now a Kubernetes [contributor](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/contributor-playground/pull/1729)! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I am in love with automation, infrastructure, architecture, and Cloud Native. I find that it is in essence, an 
epitomy of technology; where efficiency meets continuous creation.

## My Favorite Projects (so far)

### Kubernetes Homelab Powered by [Talos Linux](https://talos.dev)

What I am most proud of:

This may not seem like much, but the following image just gets me so excited.

It is an image of my Tachtit cluster connecting to an external data cluster running [CloudnativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io) 
and successfully creating data! So cool!
